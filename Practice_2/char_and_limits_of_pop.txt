Characterstics:
    1) A large program can be broken down into small managable procedures or functions.
    2) Focuses on functions rather than on data.
    3) For sharing a common data among different functions, the data is made global.
    4) Since global functions are transferred from function to function; during the course of transformation the global data may be altered.
    5) The program design of POP follows top down methodology.

Limitations:
    1) Focus on function rather than data.
    2) In large program, it is difficult to identify the belonging of global data.
    3) The use of global data is error prone and can be an obstacle in code maintainance and enhancement.
    4) The modification of global data requires the modification of those function using it.
    5) Maintaining and enhancing program code is still difficult because of global data.
    6) It does not model real world problem very well.
